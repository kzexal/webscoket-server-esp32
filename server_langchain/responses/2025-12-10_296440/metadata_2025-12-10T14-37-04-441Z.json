  "textContent": "Sure! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash the riceuntil the water runs clear. Then, measure the rice and waterin a ratio of about 1:2 (rice to water). For example, if you use 1 cup of rice,add 2 cups of water. Bring it to a boil,then reduce to a simmer. Let it cook for about 15to 20 minutes, until all the water is absorbed. Fluff it with a fork to make it fluffy, and it'sready to serve!",
