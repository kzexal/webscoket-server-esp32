Sure! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash the riceto remove any dirt or impurities. Then, measure out theright amount of rice per person—you'll need about 1/2 to 1 cup of cooked rice per person. Next,bring water to a boil in a pot, then add the rice. Stir for a bit, cover, and let it cook untilthe rice is tender and fluffy. How does that sound?
