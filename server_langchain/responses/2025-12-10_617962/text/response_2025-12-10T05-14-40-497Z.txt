Of course! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash therice to remove any dirt or impurities. Then, measure therice and water you'll need—通常是一比一的比例。Bring the water to a boil, add the rice, and stirgently. Once it's back to a boil, reduce the heatto low and let it cook until all the water is absorbed.最后，焖几分钟，让你的米饭更入味。希望这个方法对你有帮助！
