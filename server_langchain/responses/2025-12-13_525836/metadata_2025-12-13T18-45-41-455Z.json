  "textContent": "To cook rice for dinner, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Measure the Rice**: Use a measuring cup to determine how much rice you need. For a standard serving, 1 cup of uncooked rice will yield about 3 cups of cooked rice.\n\n2. **Rinse the Rice**: Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold running water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch, which can make the rice sticky.\n\n3. **Choose a Pot**: Use a pot that is large enough to hold the rice and water without overcrowding. A pot with a lid is ideal.\n\n4. **Add Water**: For every 1 cup of rice, add 1.5 to 2 cups of water. The exact amount depends on the type of rice and your preference for how soft or firm you like your rice.\n\n5. **Boil the Water**: Bring the water to a boil in the pot over medium-high heat.\n\n6. **Add Rice**: Once the water is boiling, gently pour in the rinsed rice. Stir once to prevent sticking.\n\n7. **Reduce Heat**: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and let the rice simmer. Do not lift the lid or stir the rice during this time.\n\n8. **Cook Time**: Cook the rice according to the package instructions or until the water is absorbed. For most types of rice, this will take about 15-20 minutes.\n\n9. **Turn Off Heat**: Once the rice is done, turn off the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. This allows the rice to finish steaming and absorb any remaining water.\n\n10. **Fluff the Rice**: After the resting period, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.\n\nServe your rice warm as a side dish for your dinner. Enjoy your meal with your friend!",
