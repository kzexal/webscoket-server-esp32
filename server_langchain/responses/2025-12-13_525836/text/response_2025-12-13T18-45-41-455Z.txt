To cook rice for dinner, you can follow these steps:

1. **Measure the Rice**: Use a measuring cup to determine how much rice you need. For a standard serving, 1 cup of uncooked rice will yield about 3 cups of cooked rice.

2. **Rinse the Rice**: Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold running water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch, which can make the rice sticky.

3. **Choose a Pot**: Use a pot that is large enough to hold the rice and water without overcrowding. A pot with a lid is ideal.

4. **Add Water**: For every 1 cup of rice, add 1.5 to 2 cups of water. The exact amount depends on the type of rice and your preference for how soft or firm you like your rice.

5. **Boil the Water**: Bring the water to a boil in the pot over medium-high heat.

6. **Add Rice**: Once the water is boiling, gently pour in the rinsed rice. Stir once to prevent sticking.

7. **Reduce Heat**: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a lid, and let the rice simmer. Do not lift the lid or stir the rice during this time.

8. **Cook Time**: Cook the rice according to the package instructions or until the water is absorbed. For most types of rice, this will take about 15-20 minutes.

9. **Turn Off Heat**: Once the rice is done, turn off the heat and let it sit, covered, for an additional 5 minutes. This allows the rice to finish steaming and absorb any remaining water.

10. **Fluff the Rice**: After the resting period, gently fluff the rice with a fork to separate the grains.

Serve your rice warm as a side dish for your dinner. Enjoy your meal with your friend!
