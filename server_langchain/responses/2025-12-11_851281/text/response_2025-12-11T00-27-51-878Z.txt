Of course! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash therice until it stops cloudy. Then, measure the rice and waterin a ratio of 1:2 (one part rice totwo parts water). For example, if you have 1 cupof rice, use 2 cups of water. Bring it toa boil, then let it simmer for about 15-20minutes, until all the water is absorbed. Fluff it witha fork, and it's ready to serve!
