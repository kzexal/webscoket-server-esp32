Sure! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash the riceuntil the water runs clear. Then, measure out the rice youneed and place it in a pot. Add water, making sureto have the right ratio— usually 1 cup of rice to1.5 to 2 cups of water. Bring itto a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Let it cookfor about 15-20 minutes, until all the water isabsorbed. Fluff it with a fork, and it's ready! Enjoy cooking!
