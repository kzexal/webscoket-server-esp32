Sure! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash the riceuntil it's clean and the water runs clear. Then, measurethe rice and water in a ratio of 1:1.5 (one cup of rice to 1.5 cups ofwater). For example, if you're making one cup of rice, use one cup of rice and 1.5 cups ofwater. Bring it to a boil, then lower the heat toa simmer and let it cook until all the water is absorbed,usually about 20 minutes. And there you have it, cookedrice!
