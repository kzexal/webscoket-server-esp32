For example, ifyou have 200 grams of rice, use 300 milliliters of water. Bring the water to a boil, then reducethe heat to a simmer. Cook the rice until it's tenderand fluffy, which usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes. Remember to stir occasionally. Once it's ready, let itrest for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy cooking!",
