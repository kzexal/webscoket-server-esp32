  "textContent": "Of course! cooking rice is quite simple. Here's a basicguide:\n\nFirst, wash the rice thoroughly to remove any dirt orimpurities. Then, measure the rice and water in a ratioof about 1:2 (1 part rice to 2parts water). For example, if you use 1 cup ofrice, use 2 cups of water.\n\nNext, bring thewater to a boil in a pot with a lid. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer forabout 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tenderand has absorbed most of the water.\n\nFinally, fluff upthe rice with a fork, and it's ready to serve!You can add flavor by using different types of rice, like brownor jasmine, or by stir-frying it with onions, garlic, and spices before cooking. Enjoy cooking!",
