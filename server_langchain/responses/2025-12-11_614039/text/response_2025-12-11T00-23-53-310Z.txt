Of course! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash therice to remove any dirt or impurities. Then, measure outthe rice and water in a ratio of about 1:2(one cup of rice to two cups of water). Bring thewater to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook forabout 15-20 minutes until the rice is tender and allthe water has been absorbed. Fluff it with a fork,and there you have it! Enjoy cooking!
