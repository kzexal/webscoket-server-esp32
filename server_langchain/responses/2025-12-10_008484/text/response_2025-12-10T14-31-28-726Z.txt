Sure! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash the riceuntil the water runs clear. Then, measure the rice and waterin a ratio of about 1:2 (rice to water). For example, if you use 1 cup of rice,add 2 cups of water. Bring it to a boil,then lower the heat to a simmer. Let it cook for about15-20 minutes until the rice is tender. Fluffit up, and it's ready!
