Add water in a ratio of about 1:2, depending on how fluffy you like it. Bring it toa boil, then let it simmer for about 15-20minutes. Once it's cooked, drain any excess water, andyour rice is ready! You can fluff it up with afork before serving.\n\nHope this helps, and have fun cooking foryour friend!",
