Sure! Cooking rice is pretty simple. First, wash the riceuntil the water runs clear. Then, measure out the rice youneed and add it to a pot. Pour in water or broth, making sure it's about twice the amount of rice. Bringit to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Let itcook for about 15-20 minutes, until all the liquidis absorbed. Fluff it with a fork, and it'sready to serve! Enjoy making it for your friend!
